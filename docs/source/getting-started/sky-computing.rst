Concept: Sky Computing
===============================

SkyPilot is an open-source Sky Computing framework.

.. In this page, we briefly review the concept of Sky Computing.

Overview of Sky Computing
----------------------

Today's cloud ecosystem has significant cloud lock-in. Many workloads are forced to
run in specific clouds; as a result, cloud users lose on cost savings, capacity, and
portability.

To combat this, *Sky Computing* was recently proposed in two papers from UC Berkeley:
`From Cloud Computing to Sky Computing <https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/papers/hotos21-s02-stoica.pdf>`_ and
`The Sky Above The Clouds <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07147>`_ (whitepaper).

In a nutshell, Sky Computing is a **portable multicloud** paradigm: a Sky layer
receives workloads from users and executes them in the "best" (e.g., cheapest
and most available) cloud location and infra choice. It combines clouds into a "sky", a unified compute pool.

As such, Sky Computing **enables cloud portability for (certain) workloads**, freeing users from
manually porting across clouds and abstracting away their cumbersome differences.

.. One definition of "best placement" is "cheapest and available", especially for
.. AI workloads that need expensive GPU/TPU/accelerator compute.

Cloud users and their workloads gain the following benefits:

* **Lower costs**: Sky optimizes the cost of each workload. Users gain pricing leverage due to portability.
* **Higher capacity**: Workloads can utilize diverse compute across locations, pricing models, and hardware.
* **Portability** across regions or clouds.

.. Sky can leverage, but differs from, today's multicloud systems. The latter are typically
.. "partitioned multicloud": for example, in a multicloud organization, workload
.. X always runs in cloud A and workload Y always runs in cloud B --- no portability is involved.

It is important to note that Sky Computing **benefits single-cloud users too** --- Sky can optimize across
a single cloud provider's regions/zones, pricing models, and hardware.

SkyPilot and Sky Computing
---------------------------------------------------

SkyPilot was born out of the same `UC Berkeley lab <https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/>`_  that
proposed the Sky Computing paradigm.
SkyPilot is Sky's first instantiation, and it was started to showcase Sky Computing's benefits for AI and compute-intensive
workloads.

Over the last few years, SkyPilot has grown to become widely adopted by AI teams in the industry. Today, it
is being used by ~10s to 100s of leading organizations. While the initial development team
consisted of Berkeley PhDs and researchers, the SkyPilot community today has
~100 open-source contributors from various organizations.

SkyPilot operates in a BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) model, where all resources
are launched in a user's existing cloud accounts, VPCs, and clusters.

SkyPilot is open sourced under the permissive Apache 2 license and under
active development on `GitHub <https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot>`_.

.. Why do AI and compute-intensive workloads benefit from Sky Computing?
Why does AI benefit from Sky Computing?
---------------------------------------------------

.. TODO: Convincing arguments here. Tone of 'talking to a new hire'.

AI is highly **capacity and cost intensive**, many orders of magnitude higher than prior cloud workloads:

- Capacity: AI workloads need GPUs/TPUs/accelerators.  Many teams find AI
  hardware across locations (e.g., several clusters, regions, or clouds).
- Cost: AI accelerators are highly expensive. Many teams use different pricing
  models (mix of reserved, on-demand, spot instances) and/or different hardware
  type to save costs.

Utilizing such diverse compute infra --- across locations, pricing
models, and hardware --- is therefore critical for capacity and lower costs. However,
it is a daunting infra challenge: the search space of (cloud(s), pricing models, hardware) is huge and difficult to co-optimize.

Sky Computing naturally combines diverse compute infra into a unified pool (Sky), resolving this infra challenge.
It allows AI workloads to *easily and portably utilize diverse compute infra*,
therefore improving capacity and lowering costs. Finally, these benefits are
achieved without tedious infra burden on the AI and infra teams.

.. What about data?
.. ---------------------------------------------------

.. TODO: Talk about data locality.

What if I have a single cloud?
---------------------------------------------------

Just like autodriving has different levels of autonomy (e.g., Level 1-5), one can adopt Sky Computing in increasing "levels" and benefits.

**For users on a fixed cluster** (e.g., Kubernetes, Slurm), SkyPilot provides:

- A simple interface to submit and manage AI workloads, tailored to AI users' ergonomics.
- Support for dev clusters, jobs, and serving on your cluster.
- Cost savings via autostop & better hardware utilization.
- Future-proofness: No retooling when you add other clusters or clouds in the future.

**For users on a single cloud's region/zone**, SkyPilot provides:

- Auto-retry and auto-fallback provisioner: Specify many hardware fallback targets and SkyPilot will auto-optimize and auto-retry to combat GPU shortage.
- Battle-tested job recovery, including on spot instances.
- :ref:`Simple workload packaging <quickstart>`: Wrap your existing AI projects in a simple SkyPilot YAML and have all infra tasks handled for you.
- Plus all of the benefits above.

**For users on a single cloud's multiple regions**, SkyPilot provides:

- Support for a single job to utilize multiple regions for GPU availability & faster recovery.
- Support for a model's replicas to span multiple regions for availability & cost savings.
- Plus all of the benefits above.

**For users on multiple clouds or clusters**, SkyPilot

- Combines all of your infra into a unified pool (*Sky Computing*), for higher productivity, cost savings, and capacity.
- Plus all of the benefits above.

- `SkyPlane <https://github.com/skyplane-project/skyplane>`_: Open-source tool for fast and cost-effective inter-cloud data transfer.
- `CloudCast <https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi24/presentation/wooders>`_: High-throughout, cost-aware cross-region and cross-cloud multicast.
- `FogROS2 <https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/FogROS2/about>`_: Open-source cloud robotics platform leveraging Sky Computing via SkyPilot.
- â€¦and a few more in the pipeline.
